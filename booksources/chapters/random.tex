Here is how you initialize the random number generator uniquely on each process:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
C:

// Initialize the random number generator
srand((int)(mytid*(double)RAND_MAX/ntids));
// compute a random float between [0,1]
randomfraction = (rand() / (double)RAND_MAX);
// compute random integer between [0,N-1]
randomfraction = rand() % N;
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
Fortran:

  integer :: randsize
  integer,allocatable,dimension(:) :: randseed
  real :: random_value

  call random_seed(size=randsize)
  allocate(randseed(randsize))
  randseed(:) = 1023*mytid
  call random_seed(put=randseed)
\end{verbatim}
}
