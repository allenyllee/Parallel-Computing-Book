This section gives reference information and illustrative examples
of the use of MPI. While the code snippets given here should be enough,
full programs can be found in the repository for this book
\url{https://bitbucket.org/VictorEijkhout/parallel-computing-book}.

The definitive information on OpenMP can be found on
\url{http://openmp.org/}; more tutorials can be found at

by Tim Mattson is particularly recommended.

\Level 0 {Basics}

\Level 1 {OpenMP setup}
%\commandreflabel{omp-code}

If you use OMP library routines, you have to make them known to
the compiler. In~C/C++ you include the header file \indexterm{omp.h}:
\begin{verbatim}
#include "omp.h"
\end{verbatim}
In Fortran you use a module:
\begin{verbatim}
use omp_lib
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {Directives}
\commandreflabel{omp-directives}
\index{directives|(textbf}

Directives in C/C++ are case-sensitive. Directives can be broken over
multiple lines by escaping the line end.

Directives in Fortran start with a \indextermbus{directive}{sentinel}.
If you break a directive over more than one line, all but the last line
need to have a continuation character, and each line needs to have the sentinel:
\begin{verbatim}
!$OMP parallel do &
!%OMP   copyin(x),copyout(y)
\end{verbatim}
The directives are case-insensitive.

\index{directives|)}

\Level 1 {Code and execution structure}
\commandreflabel{omp-code-structure}

Here are a couple of important concepts:
\begin{definition}
\item[structured block] An OpenMP directive is followed by an
  \indexterm{structured block}; in C~this is a single statement, a
  compound statement, or a block in braces; In Fortran it is
  delimited by the directive and its matching `\n{end}' directive.

  A~structured block can not be jumped into, so it can not start with a
  labeled statement, or contain a jump statement leaving the block.
\item[construct] An OpenMP \indexterm{construct} is the section of code
  starting with a directive and spanning the following structured block,
  plus in Fortran the end-directive. This is a lexical concept: it contains
  the statements directly enclosed, and not any subroutines called from them.
\item[region of code] A \indexterm{region of code} is defined as all statements
  that are dynamically encountered while executing the code of an OpenMP construct.
  This is a dynamic concept: unlike a `construct', it does include any subroutines
  that are called from the code in the structured block.
\end{definition}

\Level 0 {Thread stuff}

\Level 1 {Creating parallel threads}
\commandreflabel{omp-parallel}

\indexpragma{parallel}
\verbatimsnippet{hello-who-omp}

If the structure block consists only of a \n{for}/\n{do} or \n{sections} region,
you can use the combined directives
\indexpragma{parallel for},
\indexpragma{parallel do},
\indexpragma{parallel sections}.

\Level 0 {Parallel regions}
\commandreflabel{parallelregion}

The \indexpragma{parallel} pragma creates a team of threads from the current thread,
and makes each thread execute the following block.

To test whether you are in a parallel region, use
\indextermtt{omp_in_parallel}.
\begin{verbatim}
int omp_in_parallel() // C
LOGICAL omp_in_parallel() ! F
\end{verbatim}

The number of threads used can differ between parallel regions. This is known
as \indexterm{dynamic mode}. You can set this with
\indextermtt{omp_set_dynamic} and query with
\indextermtt{omp_get_dynamic}.

If a region should be executed serially under certain conditions,
the \indexpragma{if} clause can be used:
\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp parallel if (n>1000)
#pragma omp for
for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
   ...
}
\end{verbatim}

\Level 0 {Worksharing}
\commandreflabel{work-sharing}
\index{worksharing constructs|(textbf}

The OpenMP \emph{worksharing constructs} serve to distribute work
over threads.

\Level 1 {Loop parallelism}
\commandreflabel{omp-for}

The \indexpragma{for} (C) and \indexpragma{do} (Fortran) pragmas
parallelize the iterations of a loop. 
These pragmas do not create a team of threads: they
take the current team of threads and divide the loop iterations over them.
\begin{itemize}
\item The loop can not contains \n{break}, \n{return}, \n{exit} statements, or
  \n{goto} to a label outside the loop.
\item The \n{continue} statement is allowed.
\item The index update has to be an increment (or decrement) by a fixed amount.
\item The loop index variable is automatically private.
\end{itemize}

\Level 2 {Schedules}
\commandreflabel{sec:schedule}

The schedule can be declared explicitly, set at runtime
through the \indextermtt{OMP_SCHEDULE} environment variable, or left up to the runtime system
by specifying \n{auto}. Especially in the last two cases  you may want to enquire
what schedule is currently being used with
\indextermtt{omp_get_schedule}.
\begin{verbatim}
int omp_get_schedule(omp_sched_t * kind, int * modifier );
\end{verbatim}

Its mirror call is \indextermtt{omp_set_schedule}, which sets the
value that is used when schedule value \n{runtime} is used. It is in
effect equivalent to setting the environment variable
\n{OMP_SCHEDULE}.
\begin{verbatim}
void omp_set_schedule (omp_sched_t kind, int modifier);
\end{verbatim}

Here are the various schedules you can set with the
\n{schedule}\index{schedule!clause} clause:
\begin{description}
  \item[affinity] Set by using value  \indextermtt{omp_sched_affinity}
  \item[auto] The schedule is left up to the implementation. Set by
    using value \indextermtt{omp_sched_auto}
  \item[dynamic] value:~2. The modifier parameter is the
    \indexterm{chunk} size; default~1. Set by using value
    \indextermtt{omp_sched_dynamic}
  \item[guided] Value:~3. The modifier parameter is the
    \indextermtt{chunk} size. Set by using value
    \indextermtt{omp_sched_guided}
  \item[runtime] Use the value of the \indextermtt{OMP_SCHEDULE}
    environment variable. Set by using value
    \indextermtt{omp_sched_runtime}
  \item[static] value:~1. The modifier parameter is the \indexterm{chunk} size. Set by using value  \indextermtt{omp_sched_static}
\end{description}

\Level 2 {Ordered loop iterations}

If loop iterations contain code that needs to be executed in the sequence of iterates,
the \indexpragma{ordered} clause can be used:
\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp for ordered private(t)
for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
  t = F(i) // some expensive calculation
#pragma omp ordered
  a[i+1] = a[i] + t
}
\end{verbatim}

\Level 2 {Reductions}
\commandreflabel{reduction}

Arithmetic reductions: $+,*,-,\max,\min$

Logical operator reductions: \n{&,&&,|,||,^}

Fortran additionally has max and min.

\Level 1 {Master and single}

The \indexpragma{master} and \indexpragma{single} constructs
are quite similar. They both indicate that a structured block
is to be executed by only a single thread, and that all other threads
that encounter the block skip it. However, the \n{master} pragma
assigns the execution of the block to a specific thread: the master thread.
Therefore, it is technically not a worksharing construct, and thus
there is no barrier at the end of it.

The \n{single} pragma does have a barrier, which can be removed with
\n{nowait}.
\begin{verbatim}
$! omp parallel
..
$! omp single
..
$! omp end single nowait
..
$! omp end parallel
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {Sections}

\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp parallel
{
#pragma omp sections
  {
#pragma omp section
    do_thing_A();
#pragma omp section
    do_thing_B();
#pragma omp section
    do_thing_C();
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {Fortran \texttt{workshare}}
\commandreflabel{fortran-workshare}

The \indexpragma{workshare} directive exists only in Fortran.
It can be used to parallelize
the implied loops in \emph{array syntax}\index{Fortran!array syntax},
as well as  \emph{forall}\index{Fortran!forall loops} loops.

\index{worksharing constructs|)}

\Level 0 {Controlling thread data}
\commandreflabel{sec:ompdata}

\indexpragma{shared}

\Level 1 {Private data}
\commandreflabel{omp-private}

Data that is declared private with the \indexpragma{private} directive is
put on a separate \indextermbus{stack}{per thread}. The OpenMP standard
does not dictate the size of these stacks, but beware of \indextermbus{stack}{overflow}.
A~typical default
is a few megabyte; you can control it with the environment variable
\indextermtt{OMP_STACKSIZE}

\indexpragma{firstprivate}
\indexpragma{lastprivate}
\indexpragma{copyin}

\Level 1 {Defaults}

You can add clauses to an \n{omp parallel} pragma
to specify explicitly what variables are private and what variables shared.
Note the cases with default behaviour:
\begin{itemize}
\item Loop variables in an \n{omp for} are private;
\item Local variables in the parallel region are private.
\end{itemize}
You can alter this default behaviour with the \indexclause{default} clause:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \indexclauseoption{default}{none} option is good for debugging, 
  because it forces you to specify for each variable in the parallel region
  whether it's private or shared.
\item The \indexclauseoption{default}{shared} clause means that any private variables
  need to be declared explicitly.
\item The \indexclauseoption{default}{private} clause means that any shared variables
  need to be declared explicitly. This value is not available in~C.
\end{itemize}

\Level 0 {Synchronization}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{atomic} Update of a single memory location. Only certain
  specified syntax pattterns are supported. This was added in order to
  be able to use hardware support for atomic updates.
\item \texttt{barrier}: section \ref{ompref:barrier}
\item \texttt{critical}: section \ref{ref:critical}
\item \texttt{ordered}
\item locks: section \ref{ompref:locks}
\item \texttt{flush}: section \ref{ref:omp:flush}
\item \texttt{nowait}
\end{itemize}

\Level 1 {Barriers}
\label{ompref:barrier}

A barrier is a location in the code that needs to be reached
by all threads before any of them can continue. There is 
a directive for declaring an explicit barrier, but 
there are also implicit barriers associated with certain other 
directives.

\Level 2 {Explicit barriers}
\commandreflabel{exbarrier}

You saw an example above where explicit barriers are needed.
You can sometimes replace an explicit barrier by an implicit one:
\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp parallel
{
  // do something
#pragma omp barrier
  // do something else
}
\end{verbatim}
is equivalent to
\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp parallel
{
  // do something
}
#pragma omp parallel
  // do something else
}
\end{verbatim}
but the second code has more overhead in creating the team of threads a second time.

\Level 2 {Implicit barriers}

At the end of a parallel region the team of threads is dissolved and
only the master thread continues. Therefore, there is an
\emph{implicit barrier at the end of a parallel region}\index{parallel
  region!barrier at the end of}.

There is some \emph{barrier behaviour}\index{omp!for!barrier
  behaviour} associated with \n{omp for} loops and other
\emph{worksharing constructs}\index{worksharing constructs!implied
  barriers at} (see section~\ref{sec:workshare}).  For instance, there
is an \indexterm{implicit barrier} at the end of the loop. This
barrier behaviour can be cancelled with the \indexclause{nowait}
clause.

You will often see the idiom
\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp parallel
{
#pragma omp for nowait
  for (i=0; i<N; i++)
    a[i] = // some expression
#pragma omp for
  for (i=0; i<N; i++)
    b[i] = ...... a[i] ......
\end{verbatim}
Here the \n{nowait} clause implies that threads can start on the second loop
while other threads are still working on the first. Since the two loops use the same
schedule here, an iteration that uses \n{a[i]} can indeed rely on it that that 
value has been computed.

\Level 1 {Critical sections}
\commandreflabel{critical}

The pragmas \indexpragmadef{critical} and \indexpragmadef{atomic}
are two ways to indicate that a section of code can only be executed
by one thread at a time.

\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp critical [(name)] new-line
    structured-block
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {Locks}
\label{ompref:locks}

Create/destroy:
\begin{verbatim}
void omp_init_lock(omp_lock_t *lock);
void omp_destroy_lock(omp_lock_t *lock);
\end{verbatim}
Set and release:
\begin{verbatim}
void omp_set_lock(omp_lock_t *lock);
void omp_unset_lock(omp_lock_t *lock);
\end{verbatim}
Since the set call is blocking, there is also 
\begin{verbatim}
omp_test_lock();
\end{verbatim}

\Level 0 {Internal control variables}
\label{ref:omp-environ}
\index{OpenMP!environment variables|(textbf}
\index{OpenMP!library routines|(textbf}
\index{Internal Control Variable (ICV)|(textbf}

OpenMP has a number of settings that can be set through \emph{environment variables},
and both queried and set through \emph{library routines}. These settings are called
\emph{\acfp{ICV}}: an OpenMP implementation behaves as if there is an internal variable
storing this setting.

First, there are 4 \acp{ICV} that behave as if each thread has its own copy of them.
The default is implementation-defined unless otherwise noted.
\begin{itemize}
  \item It may be possible to adjust dynamically the number of threads
    for a parallel region. Varriable: \indextermtt{OMP_DYNAMIC};
    routines: \indextermtt{omp_set_dynamic},
    \indextermtt{omp_get_dynamic}.
  \item If a code contains \indextermsub{nested}{parallel regions},
    the inner regions may create new teams, or they may be executed by
    the single thread that encounters them. Variable:
    \indextermtt{OMP_NESTED}; routines \indextermtt{omp_set_nested},
    \indextermtt{omp_get_nested}. Allowed values are \n{TRUE} and
    \n{FALSE}; the default is false.
  \item The number of threads used for an encountered parallel region
    can be controlled. Variable: \indextermtt{OMP_NUM_THREADS};
    routines \indextermtt{omp_set_num_threads},
    \indextermtt{omp_get_max_threads}.
    \item The schedule for a parallel loop can be set. Variable:
      \indextermtt{OMP_SCHEDULE}; routines
      \indextermtt{omp_set_schedule}, \indextermtt{omp_get_schedule}.
\end{itemize}

Other settings:
\begin{itemize}
\item\indextermtt{omp_get_num_threads}: query the number of threads
  active at the current place in the code; this can be lower than what
  was set with \n{omp_set_num_threads}. For a meaningful answer, this
  should be done in a parallel region.
\item\indextermtt{omp_get_thread_num}
\item\indextermtt{omp_in_parallel}: test if you are in a parallel region
\item\indextermtt{omp_get_num_procs}: query the physical number of cores available.
\end{itemize}

Other environment variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \indextermtt{OMP_STACKSIZE} controls the amount of space that is
  allocated as per-thread \indexterm{stack}; the space for private
  variables.
\item \indextermtt{OMP_WAIT_POLICY} determines the behaviour of
  threads that wait, for instance for \indexterm{critical section}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \n{ACTIVE} puts the thread in a \indexterm{spin-lock}, where
    it actively checks whether it can continue;
  \item \n{PASSIVE} puts the thread to sleep until the \ac{OS} wakes
    it up.
  \end{itemize}
  The `active' strategy uses CPU while the thread is waiting; on the
  other hand, activating it after the wait is instantaneous. With the
  `passive' strategy, the thread does not use any CPU while waiting,
  but activating it again is expensive. Thus, the passive strategy
  only makes sense if threads will be waiting for a (relatively) long
  time.
\item \indextermtt{OMP_PROC_BIND} with values \n{TRUE} and \n{FALSE}
  can bind threads to a processor. On the one hand, doing so can
  minimize data movement; on the other hand, it may increase load
  imbalance.
\end{itemize}

\index{OpenMP!environment variables|)}
\index{OpenMP!library routines|)}
\index{Internal Control Variable (ICV)|)}

\Level 0 {Tasks}
\commandreflabel{omp:task}

OpenMP v4 has a \indexclause{depend} clause.
\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp task depend(dependency-type: list)
\end{verbatim}

\Level 0 {Stuff}

\Level 1 {Timing}
\commandreflabel{omp-timing}

To do \indextermsub{OpenMP}{timing} you can use any system utility;
however there is a dedicated routine \indexcommand{omp_get_wtime}
that express the time since some starting point as a double:
\begin{verbatim}
double omp_get_wtime(void);
\end{verbatim}
The starting point is arbitrary and is different for each program run;
however, in one run it is identical for all threads.

To measure a time difference:
\begin{verbatim}
double tstart,tend,duration;
tstart = omp_get_wtime();
// do stuff
tend = omp_get_wtime();
duration = tend-tstart;
\end{verbatim}
The timer resolution is given by:
\begin{verbatim}
double omp_get_wtick(void);
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {Affinity}

For performance it can be a good idea to bind threads to specific
processors or cores.  OpenMP (as of \emph{version 3.1}) has a
mechanism for \indextermbus{thread}{affinity}\index{OpenMP!version 3.1!thread
  affinity}:\indextermtt{OMP_PROC_BIND}
\begin{verbatim}
export OMP_PROC_BIND=true  
\end{verbatim}
Apart from this, compilers can have proprietary mechanism; 
e.g., for the intel compiler the variable is
\begin{verbatim}
export KMP_AFFINITY=compact,0
\end{verbatim}
for the sun compiler:
\begin{verbatim}
export SUNW_MP_PROCBIND=TRUE
\end{verbatim}
for gcc (pre-openmp 3.1)
\begin{verbatim}
export GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY=0-63
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {Relaxed memory model}
\commandreflabel{omp:flush}

\indexpragma{flush}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is an implicit flush of all variables at the start and end 
  of a \emph{parallel region}\index{parallel region!flush at}.
\item There is a flush at each barrier, whether explicit or implicit,
  such as at the end of a \emph{work sharing}\index{workshare
    !flush after}.
\item At entry and exit of a \emph{critical section}\index{critical
  section!flush at}
\item When a \emph{lock}\index{lock!flush at} is set or unset.
\end{itemize}
