This section gives reference information and illustrative examples
of the use of OpenMP. While the code snippets given here should be enough,
full programs can be found in the repository for this book
\url{https://bitbucket.org/VictorEijkhout/parallel-computing-book}.

The definitive information on OpenMP can be found on
\url{http://openmp.org/}; more tutorials can be found at
\url{http://openmp.org/wp/resources/} where the one
by Tim Mattson is particularly recommended.
