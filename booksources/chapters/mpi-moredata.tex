\Level 0 {More about data}

\Level 1 {Datatype signatures}
\label{sec:signature}
\index{datatype!signature|(}

With the primitive types it pretty much went
without saying that if the sender sends an array of doubles, the
receiver had to declare the datatype also as doubles. With derived
types that is no longer the case: the sender and receiver can declare
a different datatype for the send and receive buffer, as long as these
have the same \indextermbus{datatype}{signature}.

The signature of a datatype is the internal representation of that
datatype. For instance, if the sender declares a datatype consisting
of two doubles, and it sends four elements of that type, the receiver
can receive it as two elements of a type consisting of four doubles.

You can also look at the signature as the form `under the hood' in which MPI
sends the data.

\index{datatype!signature|)}

\Level 1 {Big data types}
\index{datatype!big|(}

The \n{size} parameter in MPI send and receive calls is of type integer,
meaning that it's maximally~$2^{31}-1$. These day computers are big enough
that this is a limitation. Derived types offer some way out: to send
a\emph{big data type} of $10^{40}$ elements you would
\begin{itemize}
\item create a contiguous type with $10^{20}$ elements, and
\item send $10^{20}$ elements of that type.
\end{itemize}
This often works, but it's not perfect. For instance, the routine
\indexmpi{MPI_Get_elements} returns the total number of basic elements sent
(as opposed to \indexmpishow{MPI_Get_count} which would return the number
of elements of the derived type). Since its output argument is
of integer type, it can't store the right value.

The \indextermbus{MPI}{3} standard has addressed this
as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item To preserve backwards compatibility, the \n{size} parameter keeps
  being of type integer.
\item The trick with sending elements of a derived type still works, but
\item There are new routines that can return the correct information about the
  total amount of data; for instance, \indexmpishow{MPI_Get_elements_x}
  returns its result as a \n{MPI_Count}.
\end{itemize}

\Level 1 {Packing}
\label{sec:pack}

One of the reasons for derived datatypes is dealing with non-contiguous data.
In older communication libraries this could only be done by \indexterm{packing} data
from its original containers into a buffer, and likewise unpacking it at the
receiver into its destination data structures.

MPI offers this packing facility, partly for compatibility with such libraries,
but also for reasons of flexibility. Unlike with derived datatypes,
which transfers data atomically, packing routines add data sequentially
to the buffer and unpacking takes them sequentially. 

This means that 
one could pack an integer describing how many floating point numbers
are in the rest of the packed message. 
Correspondingly, the unpack routine could then investigate the first integer
and based on it unpack the right number of floating point numbers.

MPI offers the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \indexmpishow{MPI_Pack} command adds data to a send buffer;
\item the \indexmpishow{MPI_Unpack} command retrieves data from a receive buffer;
\item the buffer is sent with a datatype of \indexmpishow{MPI_PACKED}.
\end{itemize}

With \indexmpishow{MPI_PACK} data elements can be added 
to a buffer one at a time. The \n{position} parameter is updated
each time by the packing routine.
\begin{verbatim}
int MPI_Pack(
  void *inbuf, int incount, MPI_Datatype datatype,
  void *outbuf, int outcount, int *position,
  MPI_Comm comm);
\end{verbatim}

Conversely, \indexmpishow{MPI_UNPACK} retrieves one element
from the buffer at a time. You need to specify the MPI datatype.
\begin{verbatim}
int MPI_Unpack(
  void *inbuf, int insize, int *position,
  void *outbuf, int outcount, MPI_Datatype datatype,
  MPI_Comm comm);
\end{verbatim}

A packed buffer is sent or received with a datatype of
\indexmpishow{MPI_PACKED}. The sending routine uses the \n{position}
parameter to specify how much data is sent, but the receiving routine
does not know this value a~priori, so has to specify an upper bound.

\verbatimsnippet{packunpack}

You can precompute the size of the required buffer as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
int MPI_Pack_size(
  int incount, MPI_Datatype datatype,
  MPI_Comm comm, int *size);
\end{verbatim}
Add one time \indexmpishow{MPI_BSEND_OVERHEAD}.
