\Level 0 {Rooted collectives: broadcast, reduce}
\label{sec:bcast}

One simple collective is the broadcast, where one process has some
data that needs to be shared with all others. One scenario is that
processor zero can parse the commandline arguments of the executable
and send the values to all other processors.
Another scenario is that you want one processor to read data from file
and send it to the other processors: this is likely to be more efficient
than having every process open the file.

The broadcast call has the following structure:
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Bcast( data..., root , comm);
\end{verbatim}
The root is the process that is sending its data.
Typically, it will be the root of a broadcast tree.
The \n{comm} argument is a communicator:
for now you can use \n{MPI_COMM_WORLD}.
Unlike with send/receive there is no message tag,
because collectives are blocking, so you can have only one collective active at a
time. 

The data in a broadcast (or any other MPI operation for that matter)
is specified as
\begin{itemize}
\item A buffer. In~C this is the address in memory of the data. This means
  that you broadcast a single scalar as \n{MPI_Bcast( &value, ... )},
  but an array as \n{MPI_Bcast( array, ... )}.
\item The number of items and their datatype. The allowable datatypes
  are such things as \n{MPI_INT} and \n{MPI_FLOAT} for~C, and
  \n{MPI_INTEGER} and \n{MPI_REAL} for Fortran, or more complicated types.
  See section~\ref{ch:mpi-data} for details.
\end{itemize}
\begin{pythonnote}
  In python it is both possible to send objects, and to send more
  C-like buffers. The two possibilities correspond (see
  section~\ref{sec:python-bind}) to different routine names; the
  buffers have to be created as \n{numpy} objects.
\end{pythonnote}
%
Example: in general we can not assume that all processes get the
commandline arguments, so we broadcast them from process~0.

\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Bcast}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:argv-bcast}
  If you give a commandline argument to a program, that argument is available
  as a character string as part of the \n{argv,argc} pair that you typically use
  as the arguments to your main program. You can use the function \n{atoi} to
  convert such a string to integer.

  Write a program where process~0 looks for an integer on the commandline, and
  broadcasts it to the other processes. Initialize the buffer on all processes, and
  let all processes print out the broadcast number,
  just to check that you solved the problem correctly.
\end{exercise}

In python we illustrate the native and numpy variants. In the native
variant the result is given as a function return; in the numpy variant
the send buffer is reused.

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:gaussjordan}
  The \indexterm{Gauss-Jordan algorithm} for solving a linear system
  with a matrix~$A$ (or computing its inverse) runs as follows:
  \begin{tabbing}
    for \=pivot $k=1,\ldots,n$\\
    \>let the vector of scalings $\ell_i=A_{ik}/A_{kk}$\\
    \>for \=column $c=k+1,\ldots,n$\\
    \>\>for \=row $r\not=k$\\
    \>\>\> $A_{rc}\leftarrow A_{rc} - \ell_r A_{rc}$\\
  \end{tabbing}
  where we ignore the update of the righthand side, or the formation
  of the inverse.

  Let a matrix be distributed with each process storing one
  column. Implement the Gauss-Jordan algorithm as a series of
  broadcasts of the scaling vectors. Replicate the right-hand side on
  all processors.

  Add partial pivoting to your implementation.

  Change your implementation to let each processor store multiple columns,
  but still do one broadcast per column. Is there a way to have only one
  broadcast per processor?
\end{exercise}

\Level 0 {Reduction}

In the broadcast operation a single data item was communicated to all
processes. Reduction operations go the other way: each process has a
data item, and these are all brought together into a single item.

Here are the essential elements of a reduction operation:
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Reduce( senddata, recvdata..., operator,
    root, comm ); 
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is the original data, and the data resulting from the
  reduction. It is a design decision of MPI that it will not by
  default overwrite the original data. The send data and receive data
  are of the same size and type: if every processor has one real
  number, the reduced result is again one real number.
\item There is a reduction operator. Popular choices are
  \indexmpishow{MPI_SUM}, \indexmpishow{MPI_PROD} and
  \indexmpishow{MPI_MAX}, but complicated operators such as finding
  the location of the maximum value exist. You can also define your
  own operators; section~\ref{ref:mpi:op-create}.
\item There is a root process that receives the result of the
  reduction. Since the non-root processes do not receive the reduced
  data, they can actually leave the receive buffer undefined.
\end{itemize}

\verbatimsnippet{reduce}

\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Reduce}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:randommax}
  Write a program where each process computes a random number, and process~0
  finds and prints the maximum generated value. Let each process print its value,
  just to check the correctness of your program.
\begin{book}
  (See~\ref{ch:random} for a discussion of random number generation.)
\end{book}
\end{exercise}

Collective operations can also take an array argument, instead of just a scalar.
In that case, the operation is applied pointwise to each location in the array.

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:randomcoord}
  Create on each process an array of length~2 integers, and put the
  values $1,2$ in it on each process. Do a sum reduction on that
  array. Can you predict what the result should be?  Code it. Was your
  prediction right?
\end{exercise}

\Level 1 {Reduce in place}

On the root, 
you need two buffers, which could be a significant memory demand
in the case of a large array to be reduced.
Therefore, you can specify \indexmpishow{MPI_IN_PLACE} as the send
buffer on the root. The reduction call then
uses the value in the receive buffer as the root's contribution to the operation.
\verbatimsnippet{reduceinplace}

In Fortran the code is less elegant because you can not do
these address calculations:
\verbatimsnippet{reduceinplace-f}

\Level 1 {Reduction operations}
\label{sec:mpi:op-create}

{\catcode`\_=12
  \begin{tabular}{|lll|}
    \hline
  MPI type&meaning&applies to\\ \hline
  \indexmpidef{MPI_MAX}&maximum&integer, floating point\\
  \indexmpidef{MPI_MIN}&minimum&\\
  \indexmpidef{MPI_SUM}&sum&integer, floating point, complex,
  multilanguage types\\

  location&\indexmpishow{MPI_DOUBLE_INT} and such\\
  \indexmpidef{MPI_MINLOC}&min value and location&\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
}

The \indexmpishow{MPI_MAXLOC} operation yields both the maximum and
the rank on which it occurs. However, to use it the input should be an
array of \n{real/int} structs, where the \n{int} is the rank of the number.

For use in reductions and scans it is possible to define your own operator.

\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Op_create( MPI_User_function *func, int commute, MPI_Op *op);
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {Reduce to all}

We started the explanation of reductions by giving the routine that
had a root process. This makes sense if, at the end of a program run,
one process needs to output some summary information. However, in many
cases all processes need the result of the reduction. For example, if
you want to scale a vector by its norm:
\begin{itemize}
\item the vector norm is the result of a reduction,
\item but each process needs this value to scale its own part of the
  vector,
\item which you could do with a broadcast operation.
\end{itemize}
This combination of reduction followed by broadcast happens often
enough that there is a combined routine: \n{MPI_Allreduce} computes a
reduction, but leaves the result on each process.

\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Allreduce}

Example: we give each process a random number, and sum these numbers together.
The result should be approximately $1/2$ times the number of processes.

\verbatimsnippet{allreducec}

For Python we illustrate both the native and the numpy variant. In the
numpy variant we create an array for the receive buffer, even though
only one element is used.

\verbatimsnippet{allreducep}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:randommaxscale}
  Extend  exercise \ref{ex:randommax}.
  Let each process compute a random number,
  and compute the sum of these numbers using the \n{MPI_Allreduce}
  routine.

  (The operator is \n{MPI_SUM} for C/Fortran, or \n{MPI.SUM} for
  Python.)
  
  Each process then scales its value
  by this sum. Compute the sum of the scaled numbers and check that it is~1.
\end{exercise}

By default MPI will not overwrite the original data with the reduction
result, but you can tell it to do so
using the \indexmpishow{MPI_IN_PLACE} specifier:
