\Level 0 {Communicators}

PETSc has a `world' communicator, which by default equals
\n{MPI_COMM_WORLD}. If you want to run PETSc on a subset of processes,
you can assign a subcommunicator to the variable \n{PETSC_COMM_WORLD}
in between the calls to \indexmpishow{MPI_Init} and
\indexmpishow{PetscInitialize}.
