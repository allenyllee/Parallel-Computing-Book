Some programmers are under the impression that MPI would not be efficient on
shared memory, since all operations are done through what looks like network calls.
This is not correct: many MPI
implementations have optimizations that detect shared memory and can
exploit it, so that data is copied, rather than going through a communication layer.
(Conversely, programming systems for shared memory such as \indexterm{OpenMP}
can actually have inefficiencies associated with thread handling.)
The main inefficiency associated with using MPI on shared memory is then
that processes can not actually share data.

The one-sided MPI calls (chapter~\ref{ch:mpi-onesided}) can also be used to
emulate shared memory, in the sense that an origin process can access data
from a target process without the target's active involvement.
However, these calls do not distinguish between actually shared memory
and one-sided access across the network.

In this chapter we will look at the ways MPI
can interact with the presence of actual shared memory. 
(This functionality was added in the \indextermbus{MPI}{3} standard.)
This relies on the \indexmpishow{MPI_Win} windows concept, but
otherwise uses direct access of other processes' memory.

\Level 0 {Recognizing shared memory}
\label{mpi-comm-split-type}

MPI's one-sided routines take a very symmetric view of processes:
each process can access the window of every other process (within a communicator).
Of course, in practice there will be a difference in performance
depending on whether the origin and target are actually
on the same shared memory, or whether they can only communicate through the network.
For this reason MPI makes it easy to group processes by shared memory domains
using \indexmpiref{MPI_Comm_split_type}.

Here the \n{split_type} parameter has to be from the following (short) list:
\begin{itemize}
\item \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_TYPE_SHARED}: split the communicator into subcommunicators
  of processes sharing a memory area.
\end{itemize}

In the following example, \n{CORES_PER_NODE} is a platform-dependent
constant:

\Level 0 {Shared memory for windows}

Processes that exist on the same physical shared memory should be able
to move data by copying, rather than through MPI send/receive calls
--~which of course will do a copy operation under the hood.
In order to do such user-level copying:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We need to create a shared memory area with
  \indexmpishow{MPI_Win_allocate_shared}, and
\item We need to get pointers to where a process' area is in this
  shared space; this is done with \indexmpishow{MPI_Win_shared_query}.
\end{enumerate}

\Level 1 {Pointers to a shared window}

The first step is to create a window (in the sense of one-sided MPI;
section~\ref{sec:windows}) on the processes on one node.
Using the \indexmpiref{MPI_Win_allocate_shared} call presumably will
put the memory close to the 
\indexterm{socket} on which the process runs.

\cverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/c/sharedbulk.c]{mpisharedwindow}

The memory allocated by \indexmpishow{MPI_Win_allocate_shared} is
contiguous between the processes. This makes it possible to do address
calculation. However, if a cluster node has a \ac{NUMA} structure, for
instance if two sockets have memory directly attached to each, this
would increase latency for some processes. To prevent this, the key
\indexmpishow{alloc_shared_noncontig} can be set to \n{true} in the
\indexmpishow{MPI_Info} object.

\cverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/c/numa.c]{winnoncontig}

Let's now consider a scenario where you spawn two MPI ranks per node,
and the node has 100G of memory.
Using the above option to allow for non-contiguous window allocation,
you hope that the windows of the two ranks are placed 50G apart.
However, if you print out the addresses, you will find that that they
are placed considerably closer together. For a small windows that distance
may be as little as~4K, the size of a \indextermsub{small}{page}.

The reason for this mismatch is that an address that you obtain with
the ampersand operator in~C is not a
\indextermsub{physical}{address}, but a
\indextermsub{virtual}{address}.
The translation of where pages are placed in physical memory
is determined by the \indextermbus{page}{table}.


\Level 1 {Querying the shared structure}

Even though the window created above is shared, that doesn't mean it's
contiguous. Hence it is necessary to retrieve the pointer to the area
of each process that you want to communicate with:
\indexmpiref{MPI_Win_shared_query}.

\cverbatimsnippet[code/mpi/shared.c]{mpisharedpointer}

\Level 1 {Heat equation example}

As an example, which consider the 1D heat equation. On each process we
create a local area of three point:
%
\cverbatimsnippet{allocateshared3pt}

\Level 1 {Shared bulk data}

In applications such as \indexterm{ray tracing}, there is a read-only
large data object (the objects in the scene to be rendered) that is
needed by all processes. In traditional MPI, this would need to be
stored redundantly on each process, which leads to large memory
demands. With MPI shared memory we can store the data object once per
node. Using as above \indexmpishow{MPI_Comm_split_type} to find a
communicator per \ac{NUMA} domain, we store the object on process zero
of this node communicator.

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:shareddata}
  Let the `shared' data originate on process zero in
  \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_WORLD}. Then:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item create a communicator per shared memory domain;
  \item create a communicator for all the processes with number zero on their
    node;
  \item broadcast the shared data to the processes zero on each node.
  \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
