Above, you saw  point-to-point operations of the two-sided type:
they require the co-operation of a sender and
receiver. This co-operation could be loose: you can post a receive
with \n{MPI_ANY_SOURCE} as sender, but there had to be both a send and
receive call. In this section, you will see one-sided communication 
routines where a process
can do a `put' or `get' operation, writing data to or reading it from
another processor, without that other processor's involvement.

In one-sided MPI operations, also known as \acf{RDMA} or 
\acf{RMA} operations, there
are still two processes involved: the \indexterm{origin}, which is the
process that originates the transfer, whether this is a `put' or a `get',
and the \indexterm{target} whose
memory is being accessed. Unlike with two-sided operations, the target
does not perform an action that is the counterpart of the action on the origin.

That does not mean that the origin can access arbitrary data on the target
at arbitrary times. First of all, one-sided communication in MPI
is limited to accessing only a specifically declared memory area on the target:
the target declares an area of
user-space memory that is accessible to other processes. This is known
as a \indexterm{window}. Windows limit how origin processes can access
the target's memory: you can only `get' data from a window or `put' it
into a window; all the other memory is not reachable from other processes.

The alternative to having windows is to use \indexterm{distributed shared memory}
or \indexterm{virtual shared memory}: memory is distributed but acts as if
it shared. The so-called \acf{PGAS} languages such as \ac{UPC} use this model.
The MPI \ac{RMA} model makes it possible to 
lock a window which makes programming slightly more cumbersome, but the
implementation more efficient.

Within one-sided communication, MPI has two modes: active RMA and
passive RMA. In \indextermsub{active}{RMA}, or \indexterm{active target synchronization},
the target sets boundaries on the time period (the `epoch')
during which its window can be accessed.
The main advantage
of this mode is that the origin program can perform many small transfers, which are
aggregated behind the scenes. Active RMA acts much like asynchronous transfer with a
concluding \n{Waitall}.

In \indextermsub{passive}{RMA}, or \indexterm{passive target synchronization},
the target process puts no limitation on when its window can be accessed.
(\ac{PGAS} languages such as \ac{UPC} are based on this model: data is 
simply read or written at will.)
While 
intuitively it is attractive to be able to write to and read from a target at
arbitrary time,
there are problems. For instance, it requires a remote agent on the target,
which may interfere with execution of the main thread, or conversely it may not be
activated at the optimal time. Passive RMA is also very hard to debug and can lead
to strange deadlocks.

\Level 0 {Windows}
\label{sec:windows}
\index{window|(}

In one-sided communication, each processor can make an area of memory
available, called a \indexterm{window}. This has the following
characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item The window is defined on a communicator, so the create call
  is collective.
\item The window size can be set individually on each process.
  A~zero size is allowed, but since window creation is collective,
  it is not possible to skip the create call.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.1]{one-sided-window}
  \caption{Collective definition of a window for one-sided data access}
  \label{fig:window}
\end{figure}
defined with respect to a communicator: each process specifies a
memory area. Routine for creating and releasing windows
are collective, so each process \emph{has} to
call them; see figure~\ref{fig:window}. 
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Info info;
MPI_Win window;
MPI_Win_create( /* memory area */, info, comm, &window );
MPI_Win_free( &window );
\end{verbatim}
(For the \n{info} parameter you can often use \indexmpishow{MPI_INFO_NULL}.)
While the creation of a window is collective, each
processor can specify its own window size, including zero, and even the type of the
elements in it.

\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Win_create}
%
The data array must not be \n{PARAMETER} or \n{static const}.

The size parameter is measured in bytes. In~C this is easily done
with the \indextermtt{sizeof} operator;
for doing this calculation in Fortran, see section~\ref{sec:f-sizeof}.

\Level 0 {Active target synchronization: epochs}
\label{sec:fence}

There are two mechanisms for \indexterm{active target synchronization}, that is,
one-sided communications where both sides are involved to the extent that they declare
the communication epoch. In this section we look at the first mechanism,
which is to use a \indexterm{fence} operation:\indexmpi{MPI_Win_fence}
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Win_fence (int assert, MPI_Win win)
\end{verbatim}
This operation is collective on the communicator of the window.
It is comparable to \n{MPI_Wait} calls for non-blocking communication.

The use of fences is somewhat complicated. The interval between two fences
is known as an \indexterm{epoch}.
You can give various hints to the system about this epoch versus the ones
before and after through the \n{assert} parameter.
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Win_fence((MPI_MODE_NOPUT | MPI_MODE_NOPRECEDE), win);
MPI_Get( /* operands */, win);
MPI_Win_fence(MPI_MODE_NOSUCCEED, win);
\end{verbatim}
In between the two fences the window is exposed, and while it is you
should not access it locally. If you absolutely need to access it
locally, you can use an \ac{RMA} operation for that. Also, there can be only one
remote process that does a \n{put}; multiple \n{accumulate} accesses are allowed.

Fences are, together with other window calls, collective operations. That means they 
imply some amount of synchronization between processes. Consider:
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Win_fence( ... win ... ); // start an epoch
if (mytid==0) // do lots of work
else // do almost nothing
MPI_Win_fence( ... win ... ); // end the epoch
\end{verbatim}
and assume that all processes execute the first fence more or less at the same time.
The zero process does work before it can do the second fence call, but all other
processes can call it immediately. However, they can not finish that second fence call
until all one-sided communication is finished, which means they wait for the zero process.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.4]{graphics/lonestar-twonode-put}%putblock
  \caption{A trace of a one-sided communication epoch where process zero only originates
  a one-sided transfer}
  \label{fig:putblock}
\end{figure}
\verbatimsnippet{putblock}

As a further restriction, you can not mix \n{Get} with \n{Put} or \n{Accumulate}
calls in a single epoch. Hence, we can characterize an epoch as an
\indextermsub{access}{epoch} on the origin, and
as an \indextermsub{exposure}{epoch} on the target.

Assertions are an integer parameter: you can add or logical-or values.
The value zero is always correct. For further information, see
section~\ref{sec:mpi-assert}.

%% Local assertions are:
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item\indexmpishow{MPI_MODE_NOSTORE} The preceding epoch did not store
%%     anything in this window.
%%   \item\indexmpishow{MPI_MODE_NOPUT} The following epoch will not store
%%     anything in this window.
%% \end{itemize}
%% Global assertions:
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item\indexmpishow{MPI_MODE_NOPRECEDE} This process made no \ac{RMA}
%%     calls in the preceding epoch.  
%%   \item\indexmpishow{MPI_MODE_NOSUCCEED} This process will make no
%%     \ac{RMA} calls in the next epoch.
%% \end{itemize}

\index{window|)}

\Level 0 {Put, get, accumulate}
\label{sec:putget}

Window areas are 
accessible to other processes in the communicator by specifying the
process rank and an offset from the base of the window.

As in the two-sided case, \indexmpishow{MPI_PROC_NULL} can be used as
a target rank.

\Level 1 {Put}

The \n{MPI_Put} routine is used to put data in the window
of a target process
%
\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Put}
%
The data is written in the buffer of the target window,
using the window parameters that were specified on the target.
Specifically, data is written starting at
\[ \mathtt{window\_base} + \mathtt{target\_disp}\times \mathtt{disp\_unit}. \]

\begin{fortrannote}
  The \n{disp_unit} variable is declared as 
\begin{verbatim}
integer(kind=MPI_ADDRESS_KIND) :: displacement
\end{verbatim}
  Specifying a literal constant, such as~\n{0}, can lead to bizarre
  runtime errors.
\end{fortrannote}

Here is a single put operation. Note that the window create and window fence calls
are collective, so they have to be performed on all processors
of the communicator that was used in the create call.
\verbatimsnippet{putblock}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:randomput}
  Write code where process~0 randomly writes in the window on 1~or~2.
  
  \verbatimsnippet{randomputskl}
\end{exercise}

\Level 1 {Get}

The \indexmpishow{MPI_Get} call is very similar.
\begin{verbatim}
int MPI_Get(void *origin_addr, int origin_count, MPI_Datatype
            origin_datatype, int target_rank, MPI_Aint target_disp,
            int target_count, MPI_Datatype target_datatype, MPI_Win
            win)
\end{verbatim}

%\verbatimsnippet{getblock}

\Level 1 {Accumulate}

A~third one-sided routine
is \indexmpishow{MPI_Accumulate} which does a reduction operation on the results
that are being put:

\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Accumulate (
  void *origin_addr, int origin_count, MPI_Datatype origin_datatype, 
  int target_rank,
  MPI_Aint target_disp, int target_count, MPI_Datatype target_datatype,
  MPI_Op op,MPI_Win window)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:countdown}

  Implement a shared counter:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item One process maintains a counter;
  \item Iterate: all others at random moments update this counter.
  \item When the counter is zero, everyone stops iterating.
  \end{itemize}
  The problem here is data synchronization: does everyone see the
  counter the same way?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Implement an `all-gather' operation using one-sided communication:
  each processor stores a single number, and you want each processor
  to build up an array that contains the values from all
  processors. Note that you do not need a special case for a processor
  collecting its own value: doing `communication' between a processor
  and itself is perfectly legal.
\end{exercise}

Accumulate is a reduction with remote result. As with \n{MPI_Reduce}, the 
order in which the operands are accumulated is undefined. 
The same predefined operators are available, but no
user-defined ones. There is one extra operator: \indexmpishow{MPI_REPLACE},
this has the effect that only the last result to arrive is retained.

\Level 1 {Put vs Get}

\begin{verbatim}
while(!converged(A)){ 
  update(A); 
  MPI_Win_fence(MPI_MODE_NOPRECEDE, win); 
  for(i=0; i < toneighbors; i++) 
    MPI_Put(&frombuf[i], 1, fromtype[i], toneighbor[i], 
                         todisp[i], 1, totype[i], win); 
  MPI_Win_fence((MPI_MODE_NOSTORE | MPI_MODE_NOSUCCEED), win); 
  } 
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
  while(!converged(A)){ 
  update_boundary(A); 
  MPI_Win_fence((MPI_MODE_NOPUT | MPI_MODE_NOPRECEDE), win); 
  for(i=0; i < fromneighbors; i++) 
    MPI_Get(&tobuf[i], 1, totype[i], fromneighbor[i], 
                    fromdisp[i], 1, fromtype[i], win); 
  update_core(A); 
  MPI_Win_fence(MPI_MODE_NOSUCCEED, win); 
  } 
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {Request-based operations}

Analogous to \n{MPI_Isend} there are request based one-sided operations:
%
\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Rput}
%
and similarly \indexmpishow{MPI_Rget} and \indexmpishow{MPI_Raccumulate}.

These only apply to passive target synchronization.
Any \indexmpishow{MPI_Win_flush...} call also terminates these transfers.

\Level 1 {Assertions}
\label{sec:mpi-assert}

The \n{MPI_Win_fence} call, as well \n{MPI_Win_start} and such, take an argument
through which assertions can be passed about the activity before, after, and during the epoch.
The value zero is always allowed, by you can make your program more efficient by specifying
one or more of the following, combined by bitwise OR in C/C++ or
\n{IOR} in Fortran.

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{MPI\_WIN\_START}] Supports the option:
  \begin{description}
    \item[\texttt{MPI\_MODE\_NOCHECK}] the matching calls to \n{MPI_WIN_POST} have already
    completed on all target processes when the call to \n{MPI_WIN_START} is
    made. The nocheck option can be specified in a start call if and
    only if it is specified in each matching post call. This is similar
    to the optimization of ``ready-send'' that may save a handshake when
    the handshake is implicit in the code. (However, ready-send is
    matched by a regular receive, whereas both start and post must
    specify the nocheck option.)
  \end{description}
\item[\texttt{MPI\_WIN\_POST}] supports the following options:
  \begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{MPI\_MODE\_NOCHECK}] the matching calls to \n{MPI_WIN_START} have not
    yet occurred on any origin processes when the call to \n{MPI_WIN_POST}
    is made. The nocheck option can be specified by a post call if and
    only if it is specified by each matching start call.
  \item[\texttt{MPI\_MODE\_NOSTORE}] the local window was not updated by local
    stores (or local get or receive calls) since last
    synchronization. This may avoid the need for cache synchronization
    at the post call.
  \item[\texttt{MPI\_MODE\_NOPUT}] the local window will not be updated by put or
    accumulate calls after the post call, until the ensuing (wait)
    synchronization. This may avoid the need for cache synchronization
    at the wait call.
  \end{description}
\item[\texttt{MPI\_WIN\_FENCE}] supports the following options:
  \begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{MPI\_MODE\_NOSTORE}] the local window was not updated by local
    stores (or local get or receive calls) since last synchronization.
  \item[\texttt{MPI\_MODE\_NOPUT}] the local window will not be updated by put or
    accumulate calls after the fence call, until the ensuing (fence)
    synchronization.
  \item[\texttt{MPI\_MODE\_NOPRECEDE}] the fence does not complete any sequence of
    locally issued RMA calls. If this assertion is given by any
    process in the window group, then it must be given by all
    processes in the group.
  \item[\texttt{MPI\_MODE\_NOSUCCEED}] the fence does not start any
    sequence of locally issued RMA calls. If the assertion is given by
    any process in the window group, then it must be given by all
    processes in the group.
  \end{description}
\item[\texttt{MPI\_WIN\_LOCK}] supports the following option:
  \begin{description}
    \item[\texttt{MPI\_MODE\_NOCHECK}] no other process holds, or will attempt to
    acquire a conflicting lock, while the caller holds the window
    lock. This is useful when mutual exclusion is achieved by other
    means, but the coherence operations that may be attached to the
    lock and unlock calls are still required.
  \end{description}
\end{description}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{3in}
  \includegraphics[scale=.08]{core-update}
\end{wrapfigure}
%
As an example, let's look at \indextermbus{halo}{update}.
The array~\n{A} is updated using the local values and the halo
that comes from bordering processors, either through Put or Get operations.

In a first version we separate computation and communication.
Each iteration has two fences. Between the two fences in the loop body
we do the \n{MPI_Put} operation; between the second and and first one
of the next iteration there is only computation, so we add the
\n{NOPRECEDE} and \n{NOSUCCEED} assertions. The \n{NOSTORE} assertion
states that the local window was not updated: the Put operation only
works on remote windows.
\begin{verbatim}
for ( .... ) {
  update(A); 
  MPI_Win_fence(MPI_MODE_NOPRECEDE, win); 
  for(i=0; i < toneighbors; i++) 
    MPI_Put( ... );
  MPI_Win_fence((MPI_MODE_NOSTORE | MPI_MODE_NOSUCCEED), win); 
  }
\end{verbatim}

Next, we split the update in the core part, which can be done purely
from local values, and the boundary, which needs local and halo
values. Update of the core can overlap the communication of the halo.
\begin{verbatim}
for ( .... ) {
  update_boundary(A); 
  MPI_Win_fence((MPI_MODE_NOPUT | MPI_MODE_NOPRECEDE), win); 
  for(i=0; i < fromneighbors; i++) 
    MPI_Get( ... );
  update_core(A); 
  MPI_Win_fence(MPI_MODE_NOSUCCEED, win); 
  }
\end{verbatim}
The \n{NOPRECEDE} and \n{NOSUCCEED} assertions still hold, but the
\n{Get} operation implies that instead of \n{NOSTORE} in the
second fence, we use \n{NOPUT} in the first.

\begin{comment}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \indexmpishow{MPI_MODE_NOCHECK}: this is used with
    \indexmpishow{MPI_Win_start} and \indexmpishow{MPI_Win_post}; it
    indicates that when the origin `start' call is made, the target
    `post' call has already been issued. This is comparable to using
    \indexmpishow{MPI_Rsend}.
  \item \indexmpishow{MPI_MODE_NOSTORE}: this is used to specify that
    the local window was not updated in the preceding epoch.
  \item \indexmpishow{MPI_MODE_NOPUT}: this is used to specify that a local
    window will not be used as target in this epoch.
  \item \indexmpishow{MPI_MODE_NOPRECEDE}: this states that the
    \indexmpishow{MPI_Win_fence} call does not conclude a sequence of
    RMA operations. If this assertion is made on any process in a window group,
    it must be specified by all.
  \item \indexmpishow{MPI_MODE_NOSUCCEED}: this states that the
    \indexmpishow{MPI_Win_fence} call is not the start of a sequence of
    local RMA calls. If any process in a window group specifies this,
    all process must do so.
  \end{itemize}
\end{comment}

\Level 1 {More active target synchronization}
\label{sec:ref:post-wait}

The `fence' mechanism (section~\ref{ref:fence}) uses a global synchronization on the
communicator of the window, which may 
lead to performance inefficiencies if processors are not in step which each other. 
There is a mechanism that is more fine-grained, by using synchronization only 
on a processor \indexterm{group}. This takes four different calls, two for starting
and two for ending the epoch, separately for target and origin.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.1]{postwait}
  \caption{Window locking calls in fine-grained active target synchronization}
  \label{fig:postwait}
\end{figure}

You start and complete an \indextermsub{exposure}{epoch} with%
\indexmpi{MPI_Win_post}\indexmpi{MPI_Win_wait}:
\begin{verbatim}
int MPI_Win_post(MPI_Group group, int assert, MPI_Win win)
int MPI_Win_wait(MPI_Win win)
\end{verbatim}
In other words, this turns your window into the \indexterm{target} for a remote access.

You start and complete an \indextermsub{access}{epoch} with%
\indexmpi{MPI_Win_start}\indexmpi{MPI_Win_complete}:
\begin{verbatim}
int MPI_Win_start(MPI_Group group, int assert, MPI_Win win)
int MPI_Win_complete(MPI_Win win)
\end{verbatim}
In other words, these calls border the access to a remote window, with the current processor
being the \indexterm{origin} of the remote access.

In the following snippet a single processor puts data on one
other. Note that they both have their own definition of the group, and
that the receiving process only does the post and wait calls.
\verbatimsnippet{postwaittwo}

\Level 1 {Passive target synchronization}
\label{sec:ref:passive-sync}

\indexmpi{MPI_Win_lock}\indexmpi{MPI_Win_unlock}
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Win_lock (int locktype, int rank, int assert, MPI_Win win)
MPI_Win_unlock (int rank, MPI_Win win)
\end{verbatim}

The \indexmpi{MPI_Fetch_and_op} call atomically retrieves an item from the window
indicated, and replaces the item on the target by doing an accumulate on it
with the data on the origin.
%
\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Fetch_and_op}

\Level 0 {More active target synchronization}
\label{sec:post-wait}

There is a more fine-grained ways of doing 
\indexterm{active target synchronization}. While fences
corresponded to a global synchronization of one-sided calls,
the \n{MPI_Win_start},
\n{MPI_Win_complete}, \n{MPI_ Win_post}, \n{Win_wait} routines
are suitable, and possibly more efficient,
if only a small number of processor pairs is
involved.  Which routines
you use depends on whether the processor is an \indexterm{origin} or
\indexterm{target}.

If the current process is going to have the data in its window accessed,
you define an \indextermsub{exposure}{epoch} by:
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Win_post( /* group of origin processes */ )
MPI_Win_wait()
\end{verbatim}
This turns the current processor into a target for access operations issued
by a different process.

If the current process is going to be issuing one-sided operations,
you define an \indextermsub{access}{epoch} by:
\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Win_start( /* group of target processes */ )
// access operations
MPI_Win_complete()
\end{verbatim}
This turns the current process into the origin of a number of
one-sided access operations.

Both pairs of operations declare a
\indextermbus{group of}{processors}; see section~\ref{sec:comm-group}
for how to get such a group from a communicator.
On an origin processor you would specify a group that includes the targets
you will interact with, on a target processor you specify a group
that includes the possible origins.

\Level 0 {Passive target synchronization}
\label{sec:passive-sync}

In \indexterm{passive target synchronization} only the origin is
actively involved: the target makes no calls whatsoever.
This means that the origin process remotely locks the window
on the target.

During an access epoch, a process can initiate and finish a one-sided
transfer.
\begin{verbatim}
If (rank == 0) {
  MPI_Win_lock (MPI_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE, 1, 0, win);
  MPI_Put (outbuf, n, MPI_INT, 1, 0, n, MPI_INT, win);
  MPI_Win_unlock (1, win);
}
\end{verbatim}
The two lock types are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \indexmpishow{MPI_LOCK_SHARED} which should be used for \n{Get}
  calls: since multiple processors are allowed to read from a window
  in the same epoch, the lock can be shared.
\item \indexmpishow{MPI_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE} which should be used for
  \n{Put} and \n{Accumulate} calls: since only one processor is
  allowed to write to a window during one epoch, the lock should be
  exclusive.
\end{itemize}
These routines make MPI behave like a shared memory system; the
instructions between locking and unlocking the window effectively
become \indexterm{atomic operations}.
%
\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Win_lock}

To lock the windows of all processes in the group of the windows, use
\indexmpishow{MPI_Win_lock_all}:
%
\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Win_lock_all}

To unlock a window, use \indexmpishow{MPI_Win_unlock} and
\indexmpishow{MPI_Win_unlock_all}.

The RMA epoch is now defined between the lock and unlock calls, and
operations are only guaranteed to be concluded after the unlock call.

\Level 1 {Atomic shared memory operations}

The above example is of limited use.
Suppose processor zero has a data structure \n{work_table}
with items that need to be processed. A~counter \n{first_work}
keeps track of the lowest numbered item that still needs processing.
You can imagine the following
\indexterm{master-worker} scenario:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each process connects to the master,
\item inspects the \n{first_work} variable,
\item retrieves the corresponding work item, and
\item increments the \n{first_work} variable.
\end{itemize}
It is important here to avoid a \indexterm{race condition}
(see section \HPSCref{sec:shared-lock}) that would result
from a second process reading the \n{first_work} variable 
before the first process could have updated it. Therefore, the reading
and updating needs to be an \indexterm{atomic operation}.

Unfortunately, you can not have a put and get call in the same access
epoch. For this reason, MPI version~3 has added certain atomic
operations, such as \indexmpishow{MPI_Fetch_and_op}.

\Level 0 {Details}

\Level 1 {Window memory}
\label{sec:mpi-alloc}

MPI Windows are strange objects. You can create them from user memory,
that is, from arrays that are normally declared in your program, or
you can use memory allocated by  MPI. In that case,
the MPI specification allows that the memory of a window can be 
separate from the regular program memory. The routine \indexmpishow{MPI_Alloc_mem}
can return a pointer to such priviliged memory.

%% Sometimes an architecture has memory that is shared between processes,
%% or that otherwise is fast for one-sided communication. To put a window
%% in such memory, it can be placed in memory that is especially
%% allocated:

\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Alloc_mem}

\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Free_mem()
\end{verbatim}
These calls reduce to \n{malloc} and \n{free} if there is no special
memory area; SGI is an example where such memory does exist.

It is also possible to have windows where the size is dynamically set.
%
\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Win_create_dynamic}
%
Memory is attached to the window:
%
\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Win_attach}
%
and its inverse:
%
\mpiRoutineRef{MPI_Win_detach}

\Level 1 {Window information}

The \indexmpishow{MPI_Info} parameter can be used to pass implementation-dependent 
information; see section~\ref{sec:mpi-info}.

\begin{verbatim}
MPI_Win_get_attr(win, MPI_WIN_BASE, &base, &flag), 
MPI_Win_get_attr(win, MPI_WIN_SIZE, &size, &flag), 
MPI_Win_get_attr(win, MPI_WIN_DISP_UNIT, &disp_unit, &flag), 
MPI_Win_get_attr(win, MPI_WIN_CREATE_FLAVOR, &create_kind, &flag), and 
MPI_Win_get_attr(win, MPI_WIN_MODEL, &memory_model, &flag) will return in base a pointer to the start of the window win, and will return in size, disp_unit, create_kind, and memory_model pointers to the size, displacement unit of the window, the kind of routine used to create the window, and the memory model, respectively.

You may wonder how one-sided communication is realized\footnote{For
  more on this subject, see~\cite{thakur:ijhpca-sync}.}. Can a processor
somehow get at another processor's data? Unfortunately, no.

Active target synchronization is implemented in terms of two-sided communication.
Imagine that the first fence operation does nothing, unless it concludes prior
one-sided operations. The Put and Get calls do nothing involving communication,
except for marking with what processors they exchange data.
The concluding fence is where everything happens: first a global operation
determines which targets need to issue send or receive calls, then the
actual sends and receive are executed.

\begin{exercise}
  Assume that only Get operations are performed during an epoch. 
  Sketch how these are translated to send/receive pairs. 
  The problem here is how the senders find out that they need to send.
  Show that you can solve this with an \indexmpishow{MPI_Scatter_reduce} call.
\end{exercise}

The previous paragraph noted that a collective operation was necessary
to determine the two-sided traffic. Since collective operations induce
some amount of synchronization, you may want to limit this.

\begin{exercise}
  Argue that the mechanism with window post/wait/start/complete operations
  still needs a collective, but that this is less burdensome.
\end{exercise}

Passive target synchronization needs another mechanism entirely.  Here
the target process needs to have a background task (process, thread,
daemon,\ldots) running that listens for requests to lock the
window. This can potentially be expensive.
