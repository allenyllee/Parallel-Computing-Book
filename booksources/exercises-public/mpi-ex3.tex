  There are rare circumstances where you actually want this serial
  behaviour. Recall from exercise~\ref{ex:hello-world-zero} that
  output from processes is not automatically serialized. Take your
  code from that exercise, and use the serialization behaviour your
  observed to force the processes to output their print statements in
  sequence.
