  Now compute the standard deviation
  \[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{ \sum_i (x_i-m)^2 }{n} } \]
  where $m$ is the average value you computed in the previous exercise.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Solve this exercise twice: once by following the reduce by a
    broadcast operation and once by using an \n{Allreduce}.
  \item Run your code both on a single cluster node and on multiple
    nodes, and inspect the TAU trace. Some MPI implementations are
    optimized for shared memory, so the trace on a single node may not
    look as expected.
  \item Can you see from the trace how the allreduce is implemented?
  \end{itemize}
