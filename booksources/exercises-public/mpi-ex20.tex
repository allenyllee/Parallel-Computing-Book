  Code a  solution where you give a task to all worker processes
  using non-blocking sends and receives, and then wait for these tasks
  with \n{MPI_Waitall}
  to finish before you give a new round of data to all workers.
  Make a trace of the execution of this and report on the total time.

  You can do this by writing a new class that inherits from \n{queue},
  and that provides its own \n{addtask} method:
\verbatimsnippet{bulkq}
  You will also have to override the \n{complete} method: when the circle
  object indicates that all coordinates have been generated, not all
  workers will be busy, so you need to supply the proper \n{MPI_Waitall}
  call.
