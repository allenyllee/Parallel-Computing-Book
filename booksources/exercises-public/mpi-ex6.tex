  Implement an `all-gather' operation using one-sided communication:
  each processor stores a single number, and you want each processor
  to build up an array that contains the values from all
  processors. Note that you do not need a special case for a processor
  collecting its own value: doing `communication' between a processor
  and itself is perfectly legal.
