Summing numbers.
Shouting out
Everyone bring to accumulator: same addition time on the accumulator,
but data movement extra time.

Divide room in two: unevenly, so you see the effect of load unbalance:
accumulator has to wait for slowest half.

Two people bring data to accumulator: observe collisions, path length,
routing.

Recursive bisection: think this over....

Broadcast through a row.....

Send to the right: show deadlock with simple program (send; receive)
show serialization under better program
if me not end: send to right
if me not start: receive from left

solution: if me odd: send;receive, otherwise receive;send

shared memory:
one student 5 5 delay, other 7 7 (make sure it doesn't add up)
both execute delay, read, update, delay, write
one updates N + 2, other N += 3
