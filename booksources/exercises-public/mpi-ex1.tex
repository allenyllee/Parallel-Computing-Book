  \label{ex:hello-world-zero}
  Write your first MPI program: make calls to \n{MPI_Comm_size} and
  \n{MPI_Comm_rank}, and let processor zero print out how many
  processes there are.

  Now alter your program so that, for instance, processor~5 prints
  `Hello, I~am processor 5~out of~12', et cetera. You will most likely
  see that the output does not appear on your screen (or in your log
  file if you run in batch mode) in sequence, or even nicely
  separated. We will fix this later.
