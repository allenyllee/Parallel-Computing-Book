    Parallel Programing in Science and Engineering

%%%% General commands %%%%

The functionality of the makefile can be discovered by 
doing "make".

%%%% Tau instrumentation %%%%

The programs in this directory can be instrumented with the TAU library.
To compile:

    module load tau
    make clean # delete all binaries
    make someprog # as before

To run in an idev session:

    make idevrun EXECUTABLE=... [OPTIONS=...]

Note! In the idev session you need to reload the tau module. Also,
you can not do the compilation with tau from inside idev, so you 
need two windows open.

To run in the batch:

    make submit EXECUTABLE=... [OPTIONS=...]

These run rules set up the TAU environment variables.

After the run:

    make tau EXECUTABLE=....

This will leave a file with extension "slog2" which can be viewed
with "jumpshot".

%%%% Mandelbrot examples %%%%

The mandelbrot examples compute the famous Mandelbrot Set
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

To make the code:

    make mandel_serial

To run

    ibrun mandel_serial steps 1234 iters 5678
where there 'steps' and 'iters' specification are optional.

where:
- steps specifies the number of pixels that the picture is going to be wide
- iters specifies the number of iterations that is used to decide
 whether a point is in the Mandelbrot set

%%%% Not Yet Working in Fortran
These codes produce a graphics file "mandelpicture.ppm".
To view:
- OS X: "open mandelpicture.ppm"
- linux (with imagemagick): "display mandelpicture.ppm"
