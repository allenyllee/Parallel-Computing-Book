Synopsis:
int MPI_Intercomm_merge
   (MPI_Comm intercomm, int high, 
    MPI_Comm *newintracomm)

Input Parameters:
intercomm : Intercommunicator (handle)
high : Used to order the groups within comm (logical) when creating the new
    communicator. This is a boolean value; the group that sets high true
    has its processes ordered after the group that sets this value to
    false. If all processes in the intercommunicator provide the same
    value, the choice of which group is ordered first is arbitrary.

Output Parameters:
newintracomm : Created intracommunicator (handle)
