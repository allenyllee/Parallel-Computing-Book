Synopsis:

int MPI_Intercomm_create
   (MPI_Comm local_comm, int local_leader,
    MPI_Comm peer_comm,  int remote_leader,
    int tag, MPI_Comm *newintercomm
);

Input parameters:

local_comm : Local (intra)communicator
local_leader : Rank in local_comm of leader (often 0)
peer_comm : Communicator used to communicate between a designated process in
    the other communicator. Significant only at the process in local_comm
    with rank local_leader.
remote_leader : Rank in peer_comm of remote leader (often 0)
tag : Message tag to use in constructing intercommunicator; if multiple
    MPI_Intercomm_creates are being made, they should use different tags
    (more precisely, ensure that the local and remote leaders are using
    different tags for each MPI_intercomm_create).

Output Parameter:
comm_out : Created intercommunicator
